user: I'm trying to build a local database of FRED data, give me a list of important economic data from FRED and show me how to query them using FRED python api?
assistant: The Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) is a comprehensive database maintained by the Research division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis that contains over 500,000 economic time series from 87 sources. The data is essential for economic research, forecasting, and analysis of both U.S. and international economies. Here's a list of some important economic indicators you might want to include in your local database:

1. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
2. Unemployment Rate
3. Consumer Price Index (CPI)
4. Producer Price Index (PPI)
5. Federal Funds Rate
6. Interest Rates (e.g., 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate)
7. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)
8. Retail Sales
9. Industrial Production Index
10. Housing Starts
11. Business Inventories
12. Consumer Confidence Index
13. S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index
14. Leading Economic Index
15. Money Supply (M2)
16. Balance of Trade
17. Labor Force Participation Rate
18. Average Hourly Earnings

To access and query FRED data using the Python API, you'll first need to install the `fredapi` package, which is a third-party tool that provides a convenient wrapper for the FRED API. It's not an official library from FRED but it's quite popular.

First, you need to install the package using pip:

```shell
pip install fredapi
```

Then, you have to obtain an API key from FRED by registering on their website. Once you have your API key, you're ready to access the data. Here is an example of how to use the `fredapi` to query unemployment rate data:

```python
from fredapi import Fred

# Replace 'your_api_key_here' with your actual FRED API key
fred = Fred(api_key='your_api_key_here')

# Get the series ID for the unemployment rate
series_id = 'UNRATE'  # This is the series ID for the U.S. Unemployment Rate

# Get the unemployment rate data
unemployment_data = fred.get_series(series_id)

# Output the first few rows of the unemployment data
print(unemployment_data.head())

# Save the data to a local CSV file
unemployment_data.to_csv('unemployment_rate.csv')
```

For any other data series, you just need to change the `series_id` to the corresponding one for the dataset you're interested in. The series ID is a unique identifier for each time series and can be found on the FRED website on the page for the data series.

Note that if you're planning to create a larger database with frequent and multiple requests, be sure to adhere to FRED's terms of use and be considerate of their API request limitations to avoid being blocked.
user: how can I get the series_id of the list of economic data?
assistant: To get the `series_id` for the economic data you're interested in, you'll have to look up each data series on the FRED website. The `series_id` is typically a short alphanumeric identifier that corresponds to a particular data series. Here is how you can find the series IDs for the economic indicators:

1. Go to the FRED website: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/
2. Use the search bar to find the dataset you're interested in by typing in the name of the economic indicator (e.g., "Consumer Price Index").
3. Select the appropriate data series from the search results. Make sure it matches the specific data you want (e.g., CPI for all urban consumers, not seasonally adjusted).
4. Once you're on the page for the data series, look for the 'Series ID' in the description. This is typically located right under the title or on the right side of the page.

For your convenience, here is a list of some of the `series_id` values for the important economic data you might include in your database:

- Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - `GDPC1` (real GDP, seasonally adjusted annual rate)
- Unemployment Rate - `UNRATE` (seasonally adjusted)
- Consumer Price Index (CPI) - `CPIAUCSL` (CPI for All Urban Consumers: All Items, seasonally adjusted)
- Producer Price Index (PPI) - `PPIACO` (Producer Price Index by Commodity: All Commodities)
- Federal Funds Rate - `FEDFUNDS` (effective federal funds rate, monthly)
- 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate - `DGS10`
- Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) - `PCE`
- Retail Sales - `RSXFS` (advance retail sales: retail trade)
- Industrial Production Index - `INDPRO` (seasonally adjusted)
- Housing Starts - `HOUST` (total housing starts, seasonally adjusted annual rate)
- Business Inventories - `BUSINV` (total business inventories)
- Consumer Confidence Index - `CCI` (for this, you may refer to the Conference Board data or the University of Michigan's index)
- S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index - `CSUSHPINSA`
- Leading Economic Index - `USSLIND`
- Money Supply (M2) - `M2SL`
- Balance of Trade - `BOPGSTB` (U.S. trade balance on goods and services)
- Labor Force Participation Rate - `CIVPART`
- Average Hourly Earnings - `CES0500000003` (average hourly earnings of all employees, total private, seasonally adjusted)

Remember to always check that the `series_id` corresponds to the right frequency (monthly, quarterly, or annual), seasonally adjusted or not, and specific dimension of the data you require (e.g., total vs. core inflation).

Once you have obtained the correct `series_id`, you can use it with the FRED API or the `fredapi` Python client, as described in the previous answer, to retrieve and integrate the data into your local database.
