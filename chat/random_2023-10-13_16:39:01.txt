user: make candle plot using the returned dataframe of df.describe(), using seaborn.
assistant: Given you want to create a "candle" plot (which is typically referred to as a box plot in data visualization), below is a simple way to do it with the abstract dataset 'df' using seaborn:

Please replace 'df' with your actual DataFrame name and 'column_name' with your actual column name to fit your specific case.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assume that 'df' is your DataFrame.
describe_df = df.describe()

# Generate Box Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8)) 
sns.boxplot(data=describe_df)
plt.title('Box Plot')
plt.show()
```  

Keep in mind that df.describe() will only consider numerical columns for statistical analysis and so the box plot. Also, usually people generate box plot for the original dataframe directly rather than the returned dataframe of df.describe().

If you want to generate box plot for all numerical columns in the original dataframe, you can do:

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8)) 
sns.boxplot(data=df)
plt.title('Box Plot')
plt.show()
```
user: how to rotate the x labels by 90 degree
assistant: If you're having trouble with the labels on the x-axis overlapping, you can rotate them by 90 degrees. Just use the `plt.xticks()` function as follows:

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8)) 
sns.boxplot(data=df)
plt.title('Box Plot')
plt.xticks(rotation=90)  
plt.show()
```

In this code snippet, the rotation parameter specifies the rotation angle in degrees. 

Set it to 90 to rotate x-axis labels to vertical, which will make them easier to read if you have many labels or if their names are long.
user: how to swap x and y
assistant: If you want to change the orientation of your box plots, you need to change the positions of data on the 'x' and 'y' parameters. 

Seaborn's `boxplot()` function normally plots values on the y-axis and categories on the x-axis. However, you can use the 'orient' parameter to change the boxplot orientation to horizontal, which will lead to swapping x and y. 

Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Assume df is your DataFrame
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 10)) # you might want to swap figure size as well
sns.boxplot(data=df, orient='h') # 'h' for horizontal
plt.title('Box Plot')
plt.yticks(rotation=0)  # adjust rotation if necessary
plt.show()
```
Note: when you swap x and y, you may want to adjust figure size and label rotation accordingly to fit your specific case.
