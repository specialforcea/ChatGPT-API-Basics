user: I have some historical stock price data with close, cash dividends and split factor, how to compute an adjustment factor that can be used to adjust close pricesï¼Ÿ
assistant: To adjust historical stock prices for dividends and stock splits, you can use an adjustment factor. The adjustment factor allows you to compare historical stock prices on a like-for-like basis as if no dividends were paid and no stock splits occurred. This is especially useful when you're analyzing long-term price performance or when calculating historical returns.

Here's how you can calculate the adjustment factor for each day:

1. **Close Price Adjustment for Splits:** If a stock split has occurred on a given day, the previous day's close price needs to be adjusted. You do this by dividing the previous close price by the split factor. For example, if a 2-for-1 split occurs, the split factor is 2. You divide the previous day's closing price by 2 to get the adjusted closing price.

2. **Dividend Adjustment:** When a cash dividend is paid, you subtract the dividend amount from the previous day's close price to adjust it. This reflects that the value of the dividend has been taken out of the stock price.

Combining these factors gives you a cumulative adjustment factor. You start with the most recent price and work backwards. Here's a step-by-step example of how to compute the adjustment factor:

- Start with the most recent day and set its adjustment factor to 1 since no adjustments are needed.
- Move to the previous day (one day back). If a split occurred on the next day, divide the adjustment factor for that day by the split ratio. If a dividend was paid on the next day, calculate the dividend adjustment by dividing the dividend per share by the previous day's closing price and subtract it from the adjustment factor of that day.
- Continue moving backwards day by day, applying the same logic: adjusting the previous day's adjustment factor for any splits or dividends that occur on the next day.

Here's a formula to calculate the adjustment factor for a specific day:

```
Adjustment Factor(Current Day) = Adjustment Factor(Previous Day) / Split Ratio(Current Day)
```

If there's a dividend, the formula becomes:

```
Adjustment Factor(Current Day) = (Adjustment Factor(Previous Day) - Dividend(Current Day) / Close Price(Previous Day)) / Split Ratio(Current Day)
```

Once you've calculated the adjustment factors for each day, you can apply these to the historical close prices to get adjusted closing prices:

```
Adjusted Close Price = Raw Close Price * Adjustment Factor
```

Remember to apply the adjustment factor moving forward in time to keep the continuity of the price series. This means starting your calculations from the earliest data point and moving towards the present, but the factors must be derived from the most recent day going backwards.
