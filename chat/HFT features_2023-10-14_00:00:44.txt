user: I'm working on using machine learning to predict high frequency stock returns, I have these data, 'imbalance_size',  'imbalance_buy_sell_flag', 'reference_price', 'matched_size',   'far_price', 'near_price', 'bid_price', 'bid_size', 'ask_price',  'ask_size', 'wap', what features can I construct out of them?
assistant: Feature engineering can greatly improve the performance of machine learning models. Here are some potential feature constructions for predicting high frequency stock returns based on the data points you provided.

1. **Spread**: Ask price - Bid price. This difference can give an idea about the competitiveness of the market.
   
2. **Mid_price**: (Ask price + Bid price) / 2. An average of the buying and selling price which can be used as a reference for future prices.
    
3. **Spread_cross**: (Ask price * Bid size + Bid price * Ask size) / (Bid size + Ask size). This is used to measure the balance between the ask and bid. 
    
4. **Bid_ask_volume_diff**: Bid size - Ask size. This shows the balance between the selling and buying quantities.
    
5. **Order_imbalance**: (Bid size - Ask size) / (Bid size + Ask size). It measures the difference between the number of shares being bought versus sold.
    
6. **Quote_change**: The change in ask_price or bid_price from the current to the next time step.
   
7. **BBO (Best Bid and Offer)**: Indicates the highest buying price and lowest selling price. You could use an indicator to flag changes in BBO over time.
   
8. **Imbalance_ratio**: imbalance_size / matched_size. This gives an idea about the ratio between imbalance size and matched size.

9. **Return**: Calculation of return from reference price ((current_price / reference_price) - 1).

10. **Depth**: Far price - near price. This could help to measure market volatility.
   
Remember, it is important to properly analyze and understand the importance of these features in your dataset. Redundant or irrelevant features can lead to overfitting in your model. It is recommended to check correlation between features and use techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensions if necessary.
