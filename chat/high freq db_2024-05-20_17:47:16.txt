user: help me build the project that gets order book and trades data through bitmart websocket and save the data into a mysql database instantly
assistant: Building a project to get order book and trade data through BitMart's WebSocket and saving the data instantly into a MySQL database involves multiple steps. Below, I'll provide a step-by-step guide on how you might approach this, including example code to connect to the BitMart WebSocket, retrieve data, and store it in a MySQL database.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

1. **Python Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed. [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or above is recommended.
2. **MySQL Setup**: Set up a MySQL database. You can use MySQL Server or any cloud-based MySQL service. Create a database and the required tables.
3. **Install Required Libraries**: You will need `websocket-client` for WebSocket communication and `mysql-connector-python` for interacting with the MySQL database. Install these using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install websocket-client mysql-connector-python
   ```

### Step 2: Prepare the MySQL Database

Create the necessary tables to store order book data and trades data. Here’s a basic example of how you might structure these tables:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE bitmart;

USE bitmart;

CREATE TABLE order_book (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    symbol VARCHAR(20),
    side VARCHAR(10),
    price DECIMAL(20, 8),
    quantity DECIMAL(20, 8),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE trades (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    symbol VARCHAR(20),
    trade_id VARCHAR(20),
    price DECIMAL(20, 8),
    quantity DECIMAL(20, 8),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Step 3: Connect to BitMart WebSocket

Create a Python script that subscribes to BitMart's WebSocket API to fetch order book and trade data:

```python
import websocket
import json
import mysql.connector
import datetime

def on_message(ws, message):
    data = json.loads(message)
    print(data)
    if 'table' in data:
        if data['table'] == 'spot/depth5':  # Assuming 'spot/depth5' is the type of data for order books
            process_order_book_data(data['data'])
        elif data['table'] == 'spot/trade':  # Assuming 'spot/trade' is the type of data for trades
            process_trade_data(data['data'])

def process_order_book_data(order_books):
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(host='localhost', database='bitmart', user='root', password='password')
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    for book in order_books:
        for order in book['bids']:
            cursor.execute("INSERT INTO order_book (symbol, side, price, quantity) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)",
                           (book['symbol'], 'bid', order[0], order[1]))
        for order in book['asks']:
            cursor.execute("INSERT INTO order_book (symbol, side, price, quantity) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)",
                           (book['symbol'], 'ask', order[0], order[1]))
    connection.commit()
    cursor.close()
    connection.close()

def process_trade_data(trades):
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(host='localhost', database='bitmart', user='root', password='password')
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    for trade in trades:
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO trades (symbol, trade_id, price, quantity) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)",
                       (trade['symbol'], trade['trade_id'], trade['price'], trade['qty']))
    connection.commit()
    cursor.close()
    connection.close()

def on_error(ws, error):
    print('Error:', error)

def on_close(ws):
    print("### closed ###")

def on_open(ws):
    ws.send(json.dumps({
        "op": "subscribe",
        "args": ["spot/depth5:BTC-USDT", "spot/trade:BTC-USDT"]
    }))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    websocket.enableTrace(True)
    ws = websocket.WebSocketApp("wss://ws-manager-compress.bitmart.com/api?protocol=1.1",
                                on_message=on_message,
                                on_error=on_error,
                                on_close=on_close)
    ws.on_open = on_open
    ws.run_forever()
```

### Step 4: Run Your Application

You can start your application by executing the Python script. Ensure your MySQL server is running and that the WebSocket endpoint used in the script is correct as per BitMart's documentation.

### Note:

- Always keep security in mind, particularly with database credentials. Consider using environment variables or secure vaults.
- Handle exceptions and errors, especially around WebSocket connections and database interactions, to ensure robustness.
- Monitor the performance, especially if subscribing to many products or during times of high volatility, as this can generate vast amounts of data quickly.

This outline gives a solid foundation for building a system to ingest and save real-time cryptocurrency data using BitMart's WebSocket API and a MySQL database. Adjustments can be made based on specific requirements or scales.
user: if I want to store 10 levels of the orderbook, how should I adjust the table structure for that?
assistant: To store 10 levels of the order book in your MySQL database, you need to adjust the table schema to accommodate each level of bid and ask separately. One effective way to do this is by modifying the `order_book` table to store each level as a separate row, indicating which level it is. You can continue using the existing design, and just add a "level" column to distinguish between various depths.

### Step 1: Modify the MySQL Table Structure

Here is the adjusted table structure including a `level` column to specify the depth of the order book (from 1 to 10):

```sql
CREATE TABLE order_book (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    symbol VARCHAR(20),
    level INT,
    side VARCHAR(10),
    price DECIMAL(20, 8),
    quantity DECIMAL(20, 8),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Step 2: Modify the Python Script

Adjust the Python script that processes the order book data to handle 10 levels. After fetching the data from the WebSocket, you should iterate up to the 10th level of bids and asks, ensuring that each level is recorded correctly.

Here’s how you might adjust the `process_order_book_data` function:

```python
def process_order_book_data(order_books):
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(host='localhost', database='bitmart', user='root', password='password')
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    for book in order_books:
        # Loop through each level
        for level in range(10):
            # Ensuring there is data for this level
            if level < len(book['bids']) and level < len(book['asks']):
                bid = book['bids'][level]
                ask = book['asks'][level]
                # Insert bid data for this level
                cursor.execute("""
                    INSERT INTO order_book (symbol, level, side, price, quantity)
                    VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s)
                """, (book['symbol'], level+1, 'bid', bid[0], bid[1]))
                # Insert ask data for this level
                cursor.execute("""
                    INSERT INTO order_book (symbol, level, side, price, quantity)
                    VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s)
                """, (book['symbol'], level+1, 'ask', ask[0], ask[1]))
    connection.commit()
    cursor.close()
    connection.close()
```

### Step 3: Testing and Optimization

- **Testing**: Test the script thoroughly to ensure it can handle updates rapidly and accurately without missing data, especially during market movements.
- **Optimization**: Depending on the frequency of updates and the number of symbols being tracked, you may need to optimize for performance. This could involve batching database writes or using more efficient data structures.

Running this updated script should populate your database with a detailed view of the order book up to 10 levels deep for each symbol you're tracking. Always ensure that your database's performance and storage are adequate to handle the volume of data being processed.

user: I'm trying to run the code on a server, how do I keep it running even when the coonnection is closed?
assistant: To ensure that your WebSocket client continues running even when the connection is temporarily lost or when it is closed due to server issues or network disruptions, you will need to implement reconnect logic. Additionally, to keep the script running on a server, you should consider using a process manager that can keep your script running continuously and restart it if it crashes.

### Implementing Reconnect Logic

Modify your WebSocket handling in the Python script to attempt reconnection when the connection is closed. This can be done by creating a loop that tries to reconnect with a certain delay.

Here’s how you can modify your script:

```python
import websocket
import json
import mysql.connector
import time

def on_message(ws, message):
    data = json.loads(message)
    if 'table' in data:
        # handle message data here
        pass

def on_error(ws, error):
    print(error)

def on_close(ws):
    print("### Connection Closed ###")
    # attempt to reconnect with an exponential back-off
    time.sleep(5)  # waiting 5 seconds before reconnecting
    print("Attempting to reconnect")
    connect_to_websocket()

def on_open(ws):
    print("### Connection Opened ###")
    # Subscribe to your data here
    ws.send(json.dumps({"op": "subscribe", "args": ["spot/depth10:BTC-USDT"]}))

def connect_to_websocket():
    websocket.enableTrace(True)
    ws = websocket.WebSocketApp("wss://ws-manager-compress.bitmart.com/api?protocol=1.1",
                                on_open=on_open,
                                on_message=on_message,
                                on_error=on_error,
                                on_close=on_close)
    ws.run_forever()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    connect_to_websocket()
```

In this code, when the WebSocket connection is closed (`on_close`), the program will wait for 5 seconds and then try to reconnect.

### Keeping the Script Running Continuously

To keep this script running continuously on a server, you can use a process manager such as **systemd**, **Supervisor**, or **pm2**. Here's an example using pm2, which is generally used for Node.js but can work with Python as well:

1. **Install Node.js and pm2**: If you don’t already have Node.js and pm2 installed, you can install them. For Node.js, you can download it from the official website or use a package manager like `apt` for Ubuntu:
   
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   sudo npm install -g pm2
   ```

2. **Run your Python script with pm2**:
   
   ```bash
   pm2 start your_script.py --interpreter=python3
   ```

   Replace `your_script.py` with your Python script filename. Set the `--interpreter` flag to `python3` or whatever your Python executable is called on your system.

3. **Set pm2 to start on boot**:
   
   ```bash
   pm2 startup
   pm2 save
   ```

These tools will help your script to automatically restart in case it fails or the server restarts. They also often provide log management systems to capture outputs/errors generated by your script, which is useful for debugging and monitoring the application.
