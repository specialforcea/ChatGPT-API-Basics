user: how do I evaluate feature importance for lightgbm models
assistant: To evaluate the feature importance of your LightGBM model, you can use the `feature_importance` function. Here are the steps:

1. Fit your LightGBM model.

```python
import lightgbm as lgb

lgb_train = lgb.Dataset(X_train, y_train)
lgb_eval = lgb.Dataset(X_test, y_test, reference=lgb_train)

params = {
    'boosting_type': 'gbdt',
    'objective': 'binary',
    'metric': {'binary_logloss', 'auc'},
}

model = lgb.train(params,
                lgb_train,
                num_boost_round=1000,
                valid_sets=lgb_eval,
                early_stopping_rounds=10)
```

2. After fitting the model, call the feature_importance method on your model.

```python
importance = model.feature_importance(importance_type='gain')
```

`importance_type` : can be "split" or "gain"

- "split" means the result is number of times the feature is used in a model.
- "gain" means the result is the total gains of splits which use the feature.

3. For better interpretation, match the importance values with your feature names. 

```python
feature_imp = pd.DataFrame(sorted(zip(model.feature_importance(),X.columns)), columns=['Value','Feature'])

print(feature_imp)
```

4. Finally, you can visualize the feature importances using libraries like matplotlib, seaborn etc.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(20, 10))
sns.barplot(x="Value", y="Feature", data=feature_imp.sort_values(by="Value", ascending=False))
plt.title('LightGBM Features (avg over folds)')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
user: 'LGBMRegressor' object has no attribute 'feature_importance'
assistant: I'm sorry for the confusion. For the sklearn wrapper of LightGBM models, you should use `feature_importances_` attribute, not `feature_importance`. You can get it like this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from lightgbm import LGBMRegressor 

#Assume X_Train includes your features and y_train is the target variable
lgbm_model = LGBMRegressor().fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get the feature importance
importances = lgbm_model.feature_importances_

# Create a data frame for visualization
feature_imp = pd.DataFrame(sorted(zip(lgbm_model.feature_importances_,X_train.columns)), columns=['Value','Feature'])

# Display the importance of each feature
print(feature_imp)

#Visualizing the feature importances
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 10))
sns.barplot(x="Value", y="Feature", data=feature_imp.sort_values(by="Value", ascending=False))
plt.title('Feature Importances')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

In this case, `lgbm_model.feature_importances_` represents the feature importance, i.e., the higher, the more important the feature. The feature importance is computed as the (normalized) total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature. It is also known as Gini importance.
user: how do I config importance type then
assistant: In LightGBM's scikit-learn wrapper (LGBMModel, LGBMRegressor, LGBMClassifier), the feature importance is calculated using 'split' type by default, and you cannot change it to 'gain'. However, you can use the Booster object to change the feature importance type.

1. First, get the `Booster` object from your fitted model.
2. Then, use the `feature_importance` method of Booster, which allows setting importance type.

```python
# Fit your LightGBM model
lgbm_model = LGBMRegressor().fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get Booster from the model
booster = lgbm_model.booster_

# Feature importance using 'gain'
importance_gain = booster.feature_importance(importance_type='gain')

# Feature importance using 'split'
importance_split = booster.feature_importance(importance_type='split')

# Create data frames 
feature_imp_gain = pd.DataFrame(sorted(zip(importance_gain, X_train.columns)), columns=['Value', 'Feature'])
feature_imp_split = pd.DataFrame(sorted(zip(importance_split, X_train.columns)), columns=['Value', 'Feature'])

# Print 
print(feature_imp_gain)
print(feature_imp_split)
```

Remember that:
- "split" means the result is the number of times the feature is used in a model.
- "gain" means the result is the total gains of splits that use the feature.
